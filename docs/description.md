# Overview

Rarefaction is a technique used to assess species richness from the results of sampling. Specifically, it is used to compare the clonal diversity of immune repertoires of different sizes.

This block performs rarefaction analysis on clonotype data. It calculates the mean number of unique clonotypes for various subsampling depths for each sample, providing insight into the clonal richness of the repertoires.
