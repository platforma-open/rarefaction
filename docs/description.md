# Overview

Performs rarefaction analysis on clonotype data from immune receptor repertoires (TCR or BCR) to assess repertoire diversity and compare clonotype richness across samples with different sequencing depths. Rarefaction is a statistical technique that estimates the expected number of unique clonotypes as a function of sampling depth, enabling fair comparison of diversity between repertoires of different sizes.

The block processes clonotype count data from VDJ processing blocks and performs random subsampling at multiple depths for each sample. At each subsampling depth, the number of unique clonotypes is recorded, and this process is repeated multiple times to generate smooth rarefaction curves representing the mean expected number of unique clonotypes. The shape and slope of these curves provide insights into repertoire diversity: steeper curves indicate higher diversity and suggest that additional sequencing would reveal more unique clonotypes, while plateauing curves indicate that most diversity has been captured at the current sequencing depth.
